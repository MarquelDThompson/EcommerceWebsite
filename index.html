  MadeItLegendary is an anonymous A.I artist based in the Bay Area. His work primarily consists of art pieces that he
  has created in collaboration with various Artificial Intelligences and software. His work is highly influenced by
  anime, manga, and pop culture with themes of Science and Science Fiction that run throughout most of his pieces. Some
  of his obvious inspirations come from the Mobile Suit Gundam series, Akira the movie, Berserk the Manga, and Studio
  Ghibli Films like Princess Mononoke.
